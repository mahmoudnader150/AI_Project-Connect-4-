# Minimax Connect 4 AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Welcome to the Minimax Connect 4 AI project! This project implements an AI for the classic Connect 4 game using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize its decision-making process.

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm:** The core AI logic is based on the Minimax algorithm, ensuring the AI makes the best possible moves to win or draw the game.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** This optimization technique reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm, making the AI more efficient and faster.
- **Connect 4 Game Logic:** Fully implements the rules and mechanics of Connect 4, including checking for wins, draws, and valid moves.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Play against the AI and see how it strategizes to outsmart you!

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the game script to start playing against the AI.
4. Take turns placing your discs in the columns, and try to connect four of your discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the AI does!
